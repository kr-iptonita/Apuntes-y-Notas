    \maketitle
Para los siguientes modelos definir el Lagrangiano y calcular las ecuaciones de Euler-Lagrange. Graficar la variación de la posición y velocidad con respecto del tiempo, así como el retrato de fase de ambos sistemas. Verificar si los modelos son análogos o no. Proponer una situación de uso para el modelo 1.
